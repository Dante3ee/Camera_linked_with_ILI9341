# Python code that uses the esp32 integrated camera to display on a TFT screen.

The idea behind this title is simply to make your **own** budget camera with simple electronics stuff.

## Features
- Display the video stream on the TFT screen

## TODO
- add basics buttons for :
  - taking pictures (really easy just extract the picture from the buffer)
  - browsing through the saved pictures
  - a system to manage the resource by reducing or increasing the framerate
